1.What prediction algorithm do you plan to use? Bayesian? Any alternatives?
2.Is there a Python library code for the algorithm?
3.What preparation do you need to do on the data.
4.Develop (and start) implementation plan.
5.Does the architecture need to be updated.
6.Get GitHub desktop working.
7.Check Project Moodle Page for Thesis layout? identify the content that you would put into each chapter.

1. Looked at Arima and Poisson distribution but using Bayesian Heirarchal model. 
2. PyMC3 is the Python library.
3. Data will needed to be converted to floats or ints from strings.
4. 
5. Updated architecture diagram to include csv file.
6. Github desktop should work now.
